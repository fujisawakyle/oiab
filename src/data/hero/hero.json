    "header2": "Frank's life was short and miserable",
    "body": "He lived in a crowded, filthy shed and was bred to grow unnaturally fast, suffering debilitating injuries and being unable to walk under his own weight. He was slaughtered for his meat when he was just five weeks old. But Frank’s not the only one to suffer this way. He’s just one of the 1 billion chickens raised for meat in the UK, the vast majority of whom suffer the very same fate in factory farms around the country."
