    "petitionText": "The BPC states that ‘confidence in British food producers is more important than ever’. With that in mind the BPC should lead the way and encourage British chicken producers to improve their animal welfare practices. It’s time for the BPC to issue a public statement calling on their members, who make up 90% of the UK’s poultry industry, to move their production from the minimum legal requirements to meet the standards of the Better Chicken Commitment. These progressive welfare standards will eliminate the worst health issues, reduce overcrowding, provide a better living environment and end the worst slaughter practices.",
    "body1": "A new set of standards — the Better Chicken Commitment — will drastically improve the lives of chickens raised for meat by eliminating the causes of their worst suffering. It’s time for the farming and food service industries to sign up to change their practices.",
    "body2": "Call on The British Poultry Council (BPC), the UK's national trade group representing the poultry meat industry, to back the Better Chicken Commitment standards.",
